  "body": "### Welcome to Vbdotnetexcelfunctioncaller Pages.\r\nThis is a class to help you call VB subs in sequence, with definition coming from an Excel cell. The VB code will be packaged in XLL, which means well protected, and also provide maximum convenience for those who wants to migrate from their old VBA macros.\r\n\r\nProject is hosted on NuGet. Please see: [https://www.nuget.org/packages/VBDotNetExcelFunctionCaller](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VBDotNetExcelFunctionCaller)\r\n### Usage\r\nIn your project VB code, create some public subs like `proc_aaa`, `proc_bbb`, `proc_ccc`. In Excel spreadsheet cells, you can specify: `act=aaa;.....;next=..`, `act=bbb;....`. Then, the program would run `proc_aaa`, then `proc_bbb`. This is a great approach to allow user to call pre-defined codes without using VBA macros (yaaks!). \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease email to [SerioudDataEngineer@hotmail.com](mailto:SerioudDataEngineer@hotmail.com) .\r\n",
